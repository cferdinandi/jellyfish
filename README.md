## Getting Started

Compiled and production-ready code can be found in the `dist` directory. The `src` directory contains development code. Unit tests are located in the `test` directory.

### 1. Include Jellyfish on your site.

```html
<script src="dist/js/jellyfish.js"></script>
```

Don't forget to add the `img/loading.gif` image to your site, too.

### 2. Add the markup to your HTML.

```html
<div data-lazy-load="img/elephant.jpg">
	<a href="img/elephant.jpg">View Photo</a>
</div>
```

You can turn any `<p>`, `<span>`, or `<div>` tag into an image lazy loader by adding the `[data-lazy-load]` data attribute. If users should have access to the image even if Jellyfish isn't compatible with their browser or the JavaScript file fails to load, include a link that points to the image source inside the wrapper element. Jellyfish will remove it when initialized.

### 3. Initialize Jellyfish.

```html
<script>
	jellyfish.init();
</script>
```

In the footer of your page, after the content, initialize Jellyfish. And that's it, you're done. Nice work!



## Installing with Package Managers

You can install Jellyfish with your favorite package manager.

* **NPM:** `npm install cferdinandi/jellyfish`
* **Bower:** `bower install https://github.com/cferdinandi/jellyfish.git`
* **Component:** `component install cferdinandi/jellyfish`



## Working with the Source Files

If you would prefer, you can work with the development code in the `src` directory using the included [Gulp build system](http://gulpjs.com/). This compiles, lints, and minifies code, and runs unit tests. It's the same build system that's used by [Kraken](http://cferdinandi.github.io/kraken/), so it includes some unnecessary tasks and Sass variables but can be dropped right in to the boilerplate without any configuration.

### Dependencies
Make sure these are installed first.

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
* [Ruby Sass](http://sass-lang.com/install)
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) `sudo npm install -g gulp`

### Quick Start

1. In bash/terminal/command line, `cd` into your project directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install required files.
3. When it's done installing, run one of the task runners to get going:
	* `gulp` manually compiles files.
	* `gulp watch` automatically compiles files and applies changes using [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/).



## Options and Settings

Jellyfish includes smart defaults and works right out of the box. But if you want to customize things, it also has a robust API that provides multiple ways for you to adjust the default options and settings.

### Global Settings

You can pass options and callbacks into Jellyfish through the `init()` function:

```javascript
jellyfish.init({
	icon: 'img/loading.gif', // Image to display when image is loading
	offset: 0, // How far below fold to begin loading images
	type: 'img', // Type of content to load ('img' or 'iframe')
	callbackBeforeIcons: function ( wrappers ) {}, // Function to run before icon is loaded
	callbackAfterIcons: function ( wrappers ) {}, // Function to run after icon is loaded
	callbackBeforeContent: function ( wrapper ) {}, // Function to run before content is loaded
	callbackAfterContent: function ( wrapper ) {} // Function to run after content is loaded
});
```

### Override settings with data attributes

Jellyfish also lets you override global settings on a content-by-content basis using the `[data-options]` data attribute:

```html
<div
	data-lazy-load="img/elephant.jpg"
	data-options='{
		"icon": "img/loading-alt.gif",
		"offset": 50,
		"type": "iframe"
	}'
>
	<a href="img/elephant.jpg">View Image</a>
</div>
```

**Note:** You must use [valid JSON](http://jsonlint.com/) in order for the `data-options` overrides to work.

### Setting Content Attributes

You can set content attributes using the `[data-load-attributes]` data attribute.

```html
<div
	data-lazy-load="img/elephant.jpg"
	data-load-attributes='{
		"class": "img-border",
		"id": "elephant",
		"title": "A picture of an elephant",
		"height": 728,
		"width:": 1024,
		"data-name": "Dumbo"
	}'
>
	<a href="img/elephant.jpg">View Image</a>
</div>
```

You can even pass data attributes along to the image or iframe this way. Here's what the example above would look like after being lazy loaded:

```html
<div data-lazy-load="img/elephant.jpg" data-load-attributes='{"class": "img-border", "id": "elephant", "title": "A picture of an elephant", "height": 728, "width": 1024'>
	<img
		class="img-border"
		id="elephant"
		title="A picture of an elephant"
		height="728"
		width="1024"
		data-name="Dumbo"
		src="img/elephant.jpg"
	>
</div>
```

**Note:** You must use [valid JSON](http://jsonlint.com/) in order for the `data-attributes` feature to work.

### Use Jellyfish events in your own scripts

You can also call Jellyfish methods to add loading icons and check for images in the viewport in your own scripts&mdash;useful if you've added content after the DOM has loaded.

### addLoadingIcons()
Replace placeholder elements with loading icons.

```javascript
jellyfish.addLoadingIcons(
	wrappers, // A node list of content selectors. ex. document.querySelectorAll('[data-lazy-load]')
	options // Classes and callbacks. Same options as those passed into the init() function.
);
```

**Example**

```javascript
var wrappers = document.querySelectorAll('[data-lazy-load]');
var options = { icon: 'img/loading.gif' };
jellyfish.addLoadingIcons( wrappers, options );
```

### checkViewport()
Check if any images are currently visibile in the viewport.

```javascript
jellyfish.checkViewport(
	wrappers, // A node list of content selectors. ex. document.querySelectorAll('[data-lazy-load]')
	options // Classes and callbacks. Same options as those passed into the init() function.
);
```

**Example**

```javascript
var wrappers = document.querySelectorAll('[data-lazy-load]');
var options = { offset: 200 };
jellyfish.checkViewport( wrappers, options );
```

#### destroy()
Destroy the current `jellyfish.init()`. This is called automatically during the init function to remove any existing initializations.

```javascript
jellyfish.destroy();
```



## Browser Compatibility

Jellyfish works in all modern browsers, and IE 9 and above.

Jellyfish is built with modern JavaScript APIs, and uses progressive enhancement. If the JavaScript file fails to load, or if your site is viewed on older and less capable browsers, links to the image files will be displayed instead (if you've used that method).



## How to Contribute

In lieu of a formal style guide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Don't forget to update the version number, the changelog (in the `readme.md` file), and when applicable, the documentation.
